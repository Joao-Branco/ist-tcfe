% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to project an AC/DC converter circuit that receives an alternating current (AC) with 230V and 50Hz and through out a transformer, an envelope detector and a voltage regulator converts it to a direct current (DC) with 12V. 

In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by simulation using \textit{Ngspice}. In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the converter circuit is presented using the tool \textit{Octave}. In Section~\ref{sec:resultsanalysis} the results obtained in the theoretical analysis are compared to the simulation results obtained in Section~\ref{sec:simulation}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

The following image shows the analysed circuit.
