\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of creating a circuit with an acceptable and real merit was achieved. The values for the ripple and for the deviation have been performed both
theoretically using the \textit{Octave} maths tool and by circuit simulation using the
\textit{Ngspice} tool. 

The merit obtained is 1.708.

The goal was not to obtain a perfect model because the merit M depends on the cost of the elements used. In this way it is possible to conclude that there is no perfect model, and the values for merit M in an iterative way. 

The simulation results matched the theoretical results, as it was possible to verify with both.
