\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing the proposed circuit has been
achieved. Nodes methods analyses have been performed both
theoretically using the \textit{Octave} maths tool and by circuit simulation using the
\textit{Ngspice} tool.

The simulation results matched the theoretical results, as it was possible to verify with both. The reason for this perfect match is the fact that the methods used in the theoretical analysis are the same used in the simulation, so the models cannot differ.
