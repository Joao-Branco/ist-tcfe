% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to project a Band-Pass filter, centred at 1KHz and with 40dB gain, that receives an alternating current (AC) with 0.01V and 1KHz. The goal was to find the best value for the figure of merit of the circuit.

In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by simulation using \textit{Ngspice}. In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the Band-Pass is presented using the tool \textit{Octave}. In Section~\ref{sec:resultsanalysis} the results obtained in the theoretical analysis are compared to the simulation results obtained in Section~\ref{sec:simulation}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

The following image shows the analysed circuit.

The OpAmp that was used in the analysed circuit has the characteristics of an OpAmp A741.
